# PCOS Classification System

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-driven classification system for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis and management. PCOS is a common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age, and its accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment.

## Features
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify PCOS based on input data such as hormonal levels, ultrasound results, and clinical symptoms.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive classification results.
- Offers insights into the factors contributing to PCOS classification to aid in personalized treatment strategies.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jvishwa06/pcos-classification-system.git`
2. Change directory: `cd pcos-classification-system`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage
1. Input patient data including hormonal levels, ultrasound results, and clinical symptoms.
2. Click on the "Classify" button to obtain the PCOS classification result.
3. Review the classification result along with any additional insights provided.
